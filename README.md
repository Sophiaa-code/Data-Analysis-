# Data-Analysis-
This is the github repository for my final data analysis class of my Bachelor's programm.
It contains two notebooks (clinics) dealing with general data anlysis steps such as EDA and machine learning models (linear regression, lasso, CV). 
Furthermore it contains the final project called DataMadness in which I did the whole data analsyis process on a data set about the environment, including a dataset recorded by an air quality monitor that was built under my supervision in a project I led. The final outcomes of this data analysis proejct are summarized in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP7EQQay668
Enjoy watching it!!
